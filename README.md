# Freight Simulator

## About the project

The freight simulator aims to help companies and consumers quickly and accurately calculate the costs and delivery times of goods to different destinations. This tool is essential for logistics planning, allowing companies to optimize their shipping operations, choose the most suitable carriers, and provide customers with transparent information about shipping options. Additionally, by considering variables such as weight, dimensions, distance, and type of transportation, the simulator helps predict costs and delivery time, facilitating decision-making and improving operational efficiency.

## How to execute

2. In the project root, run the command:
```
docker compose up -d
